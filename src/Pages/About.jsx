                        activities in India. It has streamlined associated procedures, policies and workflows
                        relating to data submission, cataloguing, viewing, retrieval and trading for all
                        stakeholders including industries, government agencies, academia and research communities.

                    <p>
                        It stores and maintains hydrocarbon exploration and production data in a safe and
                        reusable manner for long-term use. The data is preserved as per accepted NDR standards
                        and made available to entitled users.
