              <strong>New domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines:</strong> As part
              of pricing reforms for the natural gas sector, the government
              approved a new pricing scheme to further align domestic prices with
              international market prices and to raise investment for the sector.
              The same was notified on 18.10.2014 with a revision cycle of every
              six months based on the prevailing hub prices of United States,
              Alberta, United Kingdom and Russia. The price determined under this
              policy shall be applicable to all sectors uniformly. Further, under
              this policy government has decided to offer a premium on the gas to
              be produced from Deep-water areas, Ultra deep water areas and High
              Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) areas.

                  There were 12 blocks where clearances were not accorded in
                  entire block area or in part of block area because of

                  exercise area, DRDO danger zone, national parks and firing range
