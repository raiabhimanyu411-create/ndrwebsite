            <h2>Introduction to Petroleum Acreage</h2>
            <p>
              Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) under the aegis of
              Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Govt of India actively
              assesses and promotes the hydrocarbon exploration and production
              activities in India. While oil exploration has been occurring since
              the early 1860s in India, it is the past 40 years that have seen
              significant exploration, production and marketing developments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acreage releases are going to be made through OALP (Open Acreage
              Licensing Policy) with defined periodicity for the areas within
              India’s jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <p>Information documents and data packages are available for:</p>

              previous cycle and are not licensed to any other operator for E&amp;P
              activities are generally re-released in the following cycle.

            <h2>Opportunities and Developments in India</h2>
            <p>
              India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Strong
              GDP growth rate have resulted in a surging demand for energy
              including oil &amp; gas. India is the fourth largest primary energy
              consumer, after China, USA and Russia. The Government has taken
              number of measures to bring in healthy competition and public
              participation by the way, of New Exploration and Licensing Policy
              (NELP) for exploration &amp; production of oil &amp; gas in the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              The total basin area of the 26 sedimentary basins of India is close
              to 3.36 million sq km with on-land area of 1.63 million sq km and
              shallow-water of 0.41 million sq km. In the deep waters beyond the
              400m isobath, the sedimentary area has been estimated to be about
              1.32 million sq km.
            </p>

            <p>
              As on 31.03.2019, 0.099 million sq km. area is held under Petroleum
              Exploration Licenses (PELs) and 0.071 million sq km. area is held
              under Petroleum Mining Licenses (PMLs).

            <h2>Economic Profile</h2>
            <p>
              Energy drives the economic growth of a country. Crude Oil and
              Natural Gas is a vital source of primary energy in India. Domestic
              availability has not kept pace with demand resulting in increased
              imports affecting India’s energy security.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is imperative to attract more private and foreign companies to
              invest in E&amp;P sector by creating an investor-friendly climate
              through policy reforms and efficient processes.

            <h2>Investment Opportunities in India</h2>
            <p>
              India faces formidable challenges in meeting its energy
              requirements. There is urgent need to rapidly explore more areas
              to discover oil &amp; gas and unconventional resources. Govt is
              focusing on policy reforms, reduction of regulatory barriers,
              development of marginal fields and un-monetised discoveries.
